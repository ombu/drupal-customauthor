OMBU Content Author
===================

This module provides a separation between the "Content Owner" (node owner) and
the "Content Author", the displayed author for a node.


Permissions
-----------

Module provides two permissions:

- Change the Content Owner of a node
- Change the Displayed Author of a node

In addition, for the "Owner > Other Site User" autocomplete to work, the user
must have "View user profiles" permission.
